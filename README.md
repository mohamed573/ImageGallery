# ImageGallery
Android application that portrays in memory-network caching technique, using a repository class to provide a clean app architecture, and illustrating the use of the WorkManger API to run tasks on the background, in order to ensure users limited resources(space, battery etc) are utilized efficiently. To relate the techniques above, this an image gallery app that displays images of GitHub users obtained from https://api.github.com/users. The JSON objects are fetched from the API, and parsed as Kotlin objects with the use of Retrofit and MOSHI library, the network data is then cached into a structured in-memory database, and the app loads the cached data into a domain class where the repository, view and view-models can make use of it. The users' avatars are loaded into an image view using Glide library, and the images are shown on the app through a ListView Adapter. An onClick listener is implemented on the RecyclerView to navigate to a detail fragment where the user avatar and login name is then displayed.
